- Outlining and organizational features  
- Character/world building tools
- Manuscript composition environment
- Local-first data storage
- Docker implementation for easy home lab deployment and consistent development environments

**Long-term**: Extend with plugin architecture for customizable writing workflows
- Custom export formats
- Writing analytics
- Integration with other tools
- Specialized plotting aids

This is where I work on building a writing tool that actually helps my creative process, starting with the solid foundation Manuskript provides and eventually growing beyond it. The real goal is always the writing itself.
